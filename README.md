## Introduction to COVID-19 <a name="introduction-to-covid19"></a>

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 for short) is an infectious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Both the disease and the virus were unknown until the Wuhan (China) outbreak in December 2019. Since its identification, the disease has spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.

Here is a list of links provided by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/) regarding a more extensive explanation of the subject matter, ranging from what is a coronavirus to general public advicea about the current pandemic.

## Datasets and Databases <a name="datasets-and-databases"></a>
Even if the publicly available information about COVID-19 is still somewhat scarce from a data scientis viewpoint, more and more datasets are being provided from different goverment agencies and health organisms all around the world to address the problem.

Here it is all the datasets I've found at the moment:
